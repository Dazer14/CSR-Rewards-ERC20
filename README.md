## CSR Rewards ERC20

- This contract provides accounting for CSR reward eligible holders and distributes CANTO accumulated from all CSR generated by the token contract
- Non contract accounts (EOA) will automatically become reward eligible when first receiving tokens
- Auto-whitelist for new contract accounts (see below) 
- CANTO rewards can be claimed at any time
- Contract is ownerless
- Optional fee paid for turnstile withdraw call, keeps collection + distribution ongoing and automatic
- Testing/auditing still needed, not mainnet ready

### Reward Eligible Contracts
- New contracts that receive any amount of this token during their construction become reward eligible
    - Can buy off DEX, create2, etc...
- Existing smart contracts are not eligible for rewards
- Custom contracts can hold this token and collect CSR generated by the token
- Developers need to implement neccessary functions to claim rewards and transfer out
- This makes the token safe to deploy in existing contracts (pools) and permissionlessly composable

### Use
- Refer to SimpleTokenExample.sol for basic implementation
- Need to override `_afterTokenTransfer`
- Need to construct CsrRewardsERC20 with fee values
